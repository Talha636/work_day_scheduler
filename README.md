# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

## User Story

AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively

## Acceptance Criteria

With my busy work schedule, I can plan my tasks for the day. I have an updated date on the top of the page. I enter text into the giving slots defined by the hour. If I should be doing a task designated for the hour, the tasks will be red. If the tasks time has passed it will be gray, and it will be green if I still have time to do the task. When I click on the button on the right of the textbox, I can save the task so If i close my window and open it back up, I do not loose any values i've entered.
